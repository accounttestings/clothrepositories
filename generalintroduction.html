        <h1>The real Introduction&trade;</h1>
        
        <p>This website is made by a single person.</p>

        <p>This is a joke website, so don't take everything too seriously.</p>
        
        <p>There is very little content. It may not be so dependable.</p>

        <p>If you notice, none of the images are made by me (and I may have mostly forgotten where I got them), so I give credit to the original publishers of the 
            image.</p>
